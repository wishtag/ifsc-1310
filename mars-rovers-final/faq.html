      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>How many rovers has NASA sent to Mars?</h3>
      <p>NASA has sent five successful rovers to Mars: Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance.</p>

      <h3>What is the purpose of the Mars rover missions?</h3>
      <p>Each mission aims to explore the Martian surface, study its geology and climate, search for signs of past life, and prepare for future human exploration.</p>

      <h3>How do the rovers communicate with Earth?</h3>
      <p>The rovers communicate with Earth via satellites orbiting Mars, which relay data back to NASA's Deep Space Network.</p>

      <h3>Why was Jezero Crater chosen for Perseverance?</h3>
      <p>Jezero Crater is believed to have once contained a lake and river delta, making it a promising site for finding signs of ancient microbial life.</p>

      <h3>Can the rovers be controlled in real time?</h3>
      <p>No, due to the time delay in sending signals between Earth and Mars, rovers operate semi-autonomously with instructions uploaded by mission teams.</p>
