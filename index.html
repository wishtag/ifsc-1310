      <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>Progressive enhancement was a blueprint of a new way to approach web development that was more device inclusive than the “graceful degradation” approach it aimed to replace. Both of these approaches consider how well a website works on different platforms, but they look at this process differently. Graceful degradation focuses on having the best possible performance on the most current and powerful browsers and platforms. There is some support for older and less powerful browsers and systems, but it's more of an afterthought and doesn’t really see much focus or development time.  Progressive enhancement looks at things differently. This approach focuses on content rather than strictly being concerned with how the site performs on specific browsers. Using the progressive enhancement mindset allows you to focus on your content and work your way out from there. The content of the site or application forms a base that allows you to build on in order to add features and platform-specific elements and support different browsers and platforms, but the main content remains the focus of your site or application. This approach is important today because the content is what people are looking for, and they don’t want to be handicapped by needing to be on a specific platform or device. We now live in a world where everyone is consuming content on any number of devices that could be mobile phones, tablets or computers from many different manufacturers that are running one of many different operating systems and browsers. In order for a company to survive, the content of their site needs to be accessible on all platforms and devices without issues.</p>

      <h2>Mars Rover Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>I learned a lot during this semester, I’d say I was already good at designing, but everything else was new to me. I learned how to use html, css, and javascript, all things I didn’t know how to do before this. There were a lot of things I had not even considered before this class when designing a website, such as meta tags. Another thing I hadn’t considered before was using certain elements in favor of others to improve the capabilities of screen readers.</p>
      <p>As mentioned before, things I did well were designs. I’ve always liked designing things and I think I did a good job when it came to designing things for this course.</p>
      <p>If I had to start over, I don’t think I’d really do anything differently. I learned what I expected in the end. The only thing I’d do differently is to stress less about it all, because it all worked out in the end.</p>
      <p>The feedback I received for my Mars Rover site was minimal, only suggesting a few changes. One suggestion was for the rover images on the homepage to link to their information page, which I decided to implement. I also properly set up a contact page, with there previously not being one, outside of the email at the bottom of the site.</p>
